# FAA VFR Phraseology Reference (Source of Truth)

Derived from **AIM Chapter 4**, **FAA Pilot/Controller Glossary**, and **FAA Order 7110.65**.

## 1. Initial Contact (Cold Call)

**Format**: `[Facility Name], [Aircraft Callsign], [Request]`
**Pilot**: "Oakland Center, Cessna 172SP, request VFR flight following."
**ATC**: "Cessna 172SP, Oakland Center, make your request." / "Cessna 172SP, Oakland Center, go ahead."

> *AIM 4-2-3*: Pilots should state aircraft type, model, or manufacturer's name, followed by digits/letters.

## 2. Flight Following Request (VFR Traffic Advisories)

**Format**: `[Current Position], [Altitude], [Destination/Route], [Type Request]`
**Pilot**: "Cessna 2SP is over the Golden Gate Bridge, 3,500, enroute Napa, request flight following."
**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, squawk 4321, indent."
**Pilot**: "Squawk 4321, ident, Cessna 2SP."

> *AIM 4-1-15*: "Give the controller... type aircraft, altitude, present position, and destination."

## 3. Establishing Radar Contact

**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, radar contact, 5 miles north of Golden Gate Bridge, 3,500. San Francisco Altimeter 29.92."
**Pilot**: "Roger, 29.92, Cessna 2SP."

## 4. Traffic Advisories

**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, traffic 12 o'clock, 5 miles, northbound, altitude indicates 4,500, Boeing 737."
**Pilot**: "Traffic in sight, Cessna 2SP." / "Negative contact, looking, Cessna 2SP."

## 5. Handoffs (Frequency Change)

**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, contact Travis Approach on 119.9."
**Pilot**: "Travis Approach 119.9, Cessna 2SP."

**Initial Call on New Freq**: "Travis Approach, Cessna 172SP, 4,500, climbing 5,500."
> *Note*: Do not say "with you" or "checking in". Just state altitude.

## 6. Service Termination

**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, radar service terminated, squawk VFR, frequency change approved."
**Pilot**: "Squawk VFR, good day, Cessna 2SP."

## 7. Radio Check (Distinct from Flight Request)

**Pilot**: "Ground, Cessna 2SP, radio check."
**ATC**: "Cessna 2SP, readability five."
> *Rule*: Only provide readability if explicitly asked for a check. NEVER confuse a "Request" with a "Check".

## 8. Common Misconceptions (Do NOT Use)

- "With you" (Superfluous)
- "Checking in" (Generic)
- "Over" (Obsolete in VHF)
- "Breaker breaker" (CB Slang)
